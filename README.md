# HoneyPot - Discoveray Vehicle

We are building a remote vehicle to discover and take photos of the the 4th floor false ceiling.
We have enough hardware to make: **A vehicle controlled by a mounted raspberry pi, along with a fixed angle camera**

The raspberry will have a server (PHP) with a simple web interface to send commands and receive video stream. The commands sent are translated by the server to GPIO signals to controls the motors.

Important note:
The prototype built in the project will be used in other entertainment projects designed by "you". 

suggestions:
1. Making a VR Laser Tag War.
2. Use Bot over robot so he can interact with voice and answer it.
